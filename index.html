            My name is <span class="standout">Landon Carter Dicke</span>. I was born in Columbus, Ohio on July 14th 2005.
            At the time we where living in Delaware Ohio and we still are to this day, I just was born at St. Mary's Hospital.
            Before I was at the Career Center I was attending and still attending Delaware Hayes High School.
            At Hayes Highschool I participated in Band, Choir, and Golf. I only do golf now because of the schedule coming to DACC.
            Some of my favorite things to do is play Golf, Video Games, and watching the Ohio State Buckeyes football team, I really also like to bake things.
            My favorite games to play is Cold War, Terreria, and ROBLOX when im really bored.
            My favorite type of music is Rap Music. I like pop smoke, juice wrld, and techn9ne.
            That's all that I know what to share about myself.
