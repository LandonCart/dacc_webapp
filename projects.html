            I attend Delaware Hayes Highschool. I got the offer to attend here at the end of my Sophomore year when they said I could get in the App Development and Programming Program.
            I said that I would love to attend this school and I will attend DACC and Hayes for the rest of my Junior and Senior year. This is a great opportunity and I believe That
            if you get the chance to come to DACC to learn a trade I would do it in a heart beat.
